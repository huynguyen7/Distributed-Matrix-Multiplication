# CANNON'S-ALGORITHM
This repository contains basic implementations for Cannon's Algorithm (solving Distributed Matrix Multiplication):
- Numpy version (Just for math intuition).
- Complete Version (Mixed with OpenMPI for distributed tasks in processes).

__CANNON'S ALGORITHM__ is a distributed matrix multiplication algorithm for 2D grid ONLY!
